      "overview": "This Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA) report analyzes climate-related risks across key strategic sectors. The assessment evaluates hazards, exposure, and vulnerability to determine risk levels and prioritize adaptation actions.",
      "sections": "The report contains five main sections:",
      "section_1": "1. Methodology overview of risk calculations and scoring",
      "section_2": "2. Top climate risks requiring immediate attention",
      "section_3": "3. Complete risk assessment data across all sectors",
      "section_4": "4. Qualitative assessment findings from stakeholder engagement",
      "section_5": "5. Recommended next steps for climate adaptation"

      "title": "Methodology",
      "formula": "Risk scores are calculated using the formula: Risk = Hazard x Exposure x Vulnerability, where each component is normalized on a 0-1 scale. Vulnerability considers both sensitivity and adaptive capacity indicators.",
      "scoring": "Scores are normalized within hazard groups to enable comparison, with risk levels defined as: Very High (>0.8), High (0.6-0.8), Medium (0.4-0.6), Low (0.2-0.4), Very Low (<0.2)"
